E-Commerce and Innovation - Coursework 2

Assessment Description:

For this coursework, you are asked to complete the following tasks:
1. Develop a functioning e-commerce website suitable for the chosen business/enterprise.
2. Write a 1000 words (±10%) report, which analyses the outcomes of the work,
accomplished for Task 1 above. 

E-commerce website:

Design and implement a functional e-commerce website for a business/ organisation.
This can be for either the business/ organisation which you presented for your coursework
last semester (you can choose to adapt your original proposal), or for a different venture.
Your e-commerce website should contain all the necessary functionality that is typical for
a venture of this kind, including customer accounts and login. Please note, however, that
although you must have provision for the payment processing facility, you are not required
to have it fully working (i.e. the actual payment does not have to go through).
You are free to choose how you want to implement your website, i.e. you can use the
tools and technologies covered this semester (e.g. Flask); other exiting e-commerce
frameworks; or develop it from 'scratch’ by deploying own coding (e.g. PHP).
You must host all parts of your website on our School's servers (e.g. 'Project' or
'OpenShift'), i.e. all web pages of your website must be on our local server and no
redirects to external websites are allowed. Therefore, "general" website builders, such
as wix.com or squarespace.com are not suitable for this coursework. If unsure, please
ask! Moreover, the website must be deployed on the server before the coursework's
deadline, and the URL of your website must be provided in your report.
