Software Engineering - Portfolio Part B

Assessment Description:

The brief of this assessment was to develop a working prototype of an application that will allow lecturers to generate assessments for students, and allow students to sit assessments and obtain feedback for their assessment responses.

This project was developed using Python and TKinter. Lecturers may design and submit a test for students to sit. A student may sit tests, and recieve a score for their test response. Some statistical feedback is generated for lecturers according to test responses.

While this was a group project, I took responsibility for initiating development and creating the overall structure for the application, including the main menus. I was responsible for developing the 'sit formative tests' use case, and other members of the team were responsible for developing the other use cases based on the basic application structure I developed, which were 'create tests', 'sit summative tests', 'view results' and 'view statistics', some of which did not meet completion.
